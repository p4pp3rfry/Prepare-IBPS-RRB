## July 5, 2020

Before I start on this, let me see the agenda or the to-do which I had made so ambitiously :facepalm:

1. Gather/Buy all the resources required for studying
2. Review the syllabus and choose pain-strong points
3. Start on the application
4. Update StudySpace

I think I should go on this point-by-point...

### Gathering & Buying study material

I have created a .txt file with the RRB syllabus though it's more focused on Scale - 2 IT Officers. It has syllabus for all the sections and I have focused specially on the 'Professional Knowledge' part because that's where many aspirants are confused (including myself). Regarding the books, I am working towards getting my account re-instated after which I can start buying the ebooks I have mentioned [here](https://github.com/p4pp3rfry/Preparing-for-IBPS-RRB/blob/master/IBPS%20RRB%20Misc/Syllabus_and_Plan.txt) in the syllabus.

### Reviewing | Strong & Pain points

I am familiar with all the topics that are there to be covered but I will be focusing on 4-5 topics majorly, those being...

- Data Communication and Networking
- Operating System
- DBMS
- Data Structures

### Exam Application

Still didn't look into it. Have to start tomorrow i.e July 6th.

### Update StudySpace

I did this at least.
Much relieved.
